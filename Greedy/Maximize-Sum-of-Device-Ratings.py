# You are given a 2D integer array units of size m × n where units[i][j] represents the capacity of the jth unit in the ith device. Each device contains exactly n units.

# The rating of a device is the minimum capacity among all its units.

# You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

# Choose a device i that has not been used as a source before.
# Remove exactly one unit from device i and add it to any different device.
# Then mark device i as used, so it cannot be chosen again as a source.
# Return the maximum possible sum of the ratings of all devices after any number of such operations.

# Note:

# Devices can receive units from multiple devices, regardless of whether they have been selected.
# The rating of an empty device is 0.
 

# Example 1:

# Input: units = [[1,3],[2,2]]

# Output: 4

# Explanation:

# ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Select device i = 0 and transfer units[0][0] = 1 to device i = 1.
# After the transfer, the ratings are:
# Device 0 = [3]: rating[0] = 3
# Device 1 = [2, 2, 1]: rating[1] = 1
# Thus, the sum of ratings is 3 + 1 = 4.
# Example 2:

# Input: units = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]

# Output: 6

# Explanation:

# Select device i = 1 and transfer units[1][0] = 4 to device i = 0.
# After the transfer, the ratings are:
# Device 0 = [1, 2, 3, 4]: rating[0] = 1
# Device 1 = [5, 6]: rating[1] = 5
# Thus, the sum of ratings is 1 + 5 = 6.
# Example 3:

# Input: units = [[5,5,5],[1,1,1]]

# Output: 6

# Explanation:

# No transfers increase the sum of ratings. Thus, the sum of ratings is 5 + 1 = 6.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= m == units.length <= 105
# 1 <= n == units[i].length <= 105
# m * n <= 2 * 105
# 1 <= units[i][j] <= 105
