# You are given an integer n.

# An integer x is considered good if there exist at least two distinct pairs (a, b) such that:

# a and b are positive integers.
# a <= b
# x = a3 + b3
# Return an array containing all good integers less than or equal to n, sorted in ascending order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 4104

# Output: [1729,4104]

# Explanation:

# Among integers less than or equal to 4104, the good integers are:

# 1729: 13 + 123 = 1729 and 93 + 103 = 1729.
# 4104: 23 + 163 = 4104 and 93 + 153 = 4104.
# Thus, the answer is [1729, 4104].

# Example 2:

# Input: n = 578

# Output: []

# Explanation:

# There are no good integers less than or equal to 578, so the answer is an empty array.

 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= n <= 109

                if x in last and x <= n:
                    output.add(x)

                last.add(x)
