# Given an array of integers cost and an integer target, return the maximum integer you can paint under the following rules:

# The cost of painting a digit (i + 1) is given by cost[i] (0-indexed).
# The total cost used must be equal to target.
# The integer does not have 0 digits.
# Since the answer may be very large, return it as a string. If there is no way to paint any integer given the condition, return "0".

 

# Example 1:

# Input: cost = [4,3,2,5,6,7,2,5,5], target = 9
# Output: "7772"
# Explanation: The cost to paint the digit '7' is 2, and the digit '2' is 3. Then cost("7772") = 2*3+ 3*1 = 9. You could also paint "977", but "7772" is the largest number.
# Digit    cost
#   1  ->   4
#   2  ->   3
#   3  ->   2
#   4  ->   5
#   5  ->   6
#   6  ->   7
#   7  ->   2
#   8  ->   5
#   9  ->   5
# Example 2:

# Input: cost = [7,6,5,5,5,6,8,7,8], target = 12
# Output: "85"
# Explanation: The cost to paint the digit '8' is 7, and the digit '5' is 5. Then cost("85") = 7 + 5 = 12.
# Example 3:

# Input: cost = [2,4,6,2,4,6,4,4,4], target = 5
# Output: "0"
# Explanation: It is impossible to paint any integer with total cost equal to target.
 

# Constraints:

# cost.length == 9
# 1 <= cost[i], target <= 5000
