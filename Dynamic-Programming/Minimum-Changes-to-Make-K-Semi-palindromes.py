# Given a string s and an integer k, partition s into k substrings such that the letter changes needed to make each substring a semi-palindrome are minimized.

# Return the minimum number of letter changes required.

# A semi-palindrome is a special type of string that can be divided into palindromes based on a repeating pattern. To check if a string is a semi-palindrome:​

# Choose a positive divisor d of the string's length. d can range from 1 up to, but not including, the string's length. For a string of length 1, it does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only divisor is its length, which is not allowed.
# For a given divisor d, divide the string into groups where each group contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of length d. Specifically, the first group consists of characters at positions 1, 1 + d, 1 + 2d, and so on; the second group includes characters at positions 2, 2 + d, 2 + 2d, etc.
# The string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a palindrome.
# Consider the string "abcabc":

# The length of "abcabc" is 6. Valid divisors are 1, 2, and 3.
# For d = 1: The entire string "abcabc" forms one group. Not a palindrome.
# For d = 2:
# Group 1 (positions 1, 3, 5): "acb"
# Group 2 (positions 2, 4, 6): "bac"
# Neither group forms a palindrome.
# For d = 3:
# Group 1 (positions 1, 4): "aa"
# Group 2 (positions 2, 5): "bb"
# Group 3 (positions 3, 6): "cc"
# All groups form palindromes. Therefore, "abcabc" is a semi-palindrome.
 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abcac", k = 2

# Output: 1

# Explanation: Divide s into "ab" and "cac". "cac" is already semi-palindrome. Change "ab" to "aa", it becomes semi-palindrome with d = 1.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "abcdef", k = 2

# Output: 2

# Explanation: Divide s into substrings "abc" and "def". Each needs one change to become semi-palindrome.

# Example 3:

# Input: s = "aabbaa", k = 3

# Output: 0

# Explanation: Divide s into substrings "aa", "bb" and "aa". All are already semi-palindromes.

 

# Constraints:

# 2 <= s.length <= 200
# 1 <= k <= s.length / 2
# s contains only lowercase English letters.
