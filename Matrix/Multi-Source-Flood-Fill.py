# You are given two integers n and m representing the number of rows and columns of a grid, respectively.

# You are also given a 2D integer array sources, where sources[i] = [ri, ci, color​​​​​​​i] indicates that the cell (ri, ci) is initially colored with colori. All other cells are initially uncolored and represented as 0.

# At each time step, every currently colored cell spreads its color to all adjacent uncolored cells in the four directions: up, down, left, and right. All spreads happen simultaneously.

# If multiple colors reach the same uncolored cell at the same time step, the cell takes the color with the maximum value.

# The process continues until no more cells can be colored.

# Return a 2D integer array representing the final state of the grid, where each cell contains its final color.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 3, m = 3, sources = [[0,0,1],[2,2,2]]

# Output: [[1,1,2],[1,2,2],[2,2,2]]

# Explanation:

# The grid at each time step is as follows:

# ​​​​​​​

# At time step 2, cells (0, 2), (1, 1), and (2, 0) are reached by both colors, so they are assigned color 2 as it has the maximum value among them.

# Example 2:

# Input: n = 3, m = 3, sources = [[0,1,3],[1,1,5]]

# Output: [[3,3,3],[5,5,5],[5,5,5]]

# Explanation:

# The grid at each time step is as follows:



# Example 3:

# Input: n = 2, m = 2, sources = [[1,1,5]]

# Output: [[5,5],[5,5]]

# Explanation:

# The grid at each time step is as follows:

# ​​​​​​​

# Since there is only one source, all cells are assigned the same color.

 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= n, m <= 105
# 1 <= n * m <= 105
# 1 <= sources.length <= n * m
# sources[i] = [ri, ci, colori]
# 0 <= ri <= n - 1
# 0 <= ci <= m - 1
# 1 <= colori <= 106​​​​​​​
# All (ri, ci​​​​​​​) in sources are distinct.
