# You are given an integer array nums where nums is strictly increasing.

# For each index x, let closest(x) be the adjacent index y such that abs(nums[x] - nums[y]) is minimized. If both adjacent indices exist and give the same difference, choose the smaller index.

# From any index x, you can move in two ways:

# To any index y with cost abs(nums[x] - nums[y]), or
# To closest(x) with cost 1.
# You are also given a 2D integer array queries, where each queries[i] = [li, ri].

# For each query, calculate the minimum total cost to move from index li to index ri.

# Return an integer array ans, where ans[i] is the answer for the ith query.

# The absolute difference between two values x and y is defined as abs(x - y).

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [-5,-2,3], queries = [[0,2],[2,0],[1,2]]

# Output: [6,2,5]

# Explanation:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

# The closest indices are [1, 0, 1] respectively.
# For [0, 2], the path 0 → 1 → 2 uses a closest move from index 0 to 1 with cost 1 and a move from index 1 to 2 with cost |-2 - 3| = 5, giving total 1 + 5 = 6.
# For [2, 0], the path 2 → 1 → 0 uses two closest moves from index 2 to 1 and from index 1 to 0, each with cost 1, giving total 2.
# For [1, 2], the direct move from index 1 to index 2 has cost |-2 - 3| = 5, which is optimal.
# Thus, ans = [6, 2, 5].

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [0,2,3,9], queries = [[3,0],[1,2],[2,0]]

# Output: [4,1,3]

# Explanation:

# The closest indices are [1, 2, 1, 2] respectively.
# For [3, 0], the path 3 → 2 → 1 → 0 uses closest moves from index 3 to 2 and from 2 to 1, each with cost 1, and a move from 1 to 0 with cost |2 - 0| = 2, giving total 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
# For [1, 2], the closest move from index 1 to 2 has cost 1.
# For [2, 0], the path 2 → 1 → 0 uses a closest move from index 2 to 1 with cost 1 and a move from 1 to 0 with cost |2 - 0| = 2, giving total 1 + 2 = 3.
# Thus, ans = [4, 1, 3].

 

# Constraints:

# 2 <= nums.length <= 105
# -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
# nums is strictly increasing
# 1 <= queries.length <= 105
# queries[i] = [li, ri]​​​​​​​
# 0 <= li, ri < nums.length
